//6.1 Introduction to Objects

//it aggregates multiple values (primitivevalues or other objects) 
//and allows you to store and retrieve those values by name.

//An object is an unordered collection of properties,
//each of which has a name and a value.

//JavaScript object also inherits the properties
//of another object, known as its “prototype.”

//A property has a name and a value.

//A property name may be any string, including the empty string (or any Symbol), 
//but no object may have two properties with the same name.
